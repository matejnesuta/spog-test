# SPoG-test
Automation tests for the SPoG UI

This repo deals with UI automation tests for the UI part of the Trustification product.
The infrastructure is Playwright and the language used is Python.
Along the way there will be attempts to send these tests to the team running the Trustification repo (https://github.com/trustification/trustification)
The purpose of this is to allow the Trustification team that is implementing REST API using Rust 
code, to run the UI tests with their own tests in their pipeline and create a kind of integration tests.
